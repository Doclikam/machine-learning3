***Skin Cancer Detection**


**Problem Statement**

Skin cancer is among the most diagnosed cancers globally. Evaluation of both benign and neoplastic skin lesions is critical to ensure early detection of neoplasms and therefore early treatment optimizing clinical outcomes.

The goal of this work is to develop a machine learning model for skin cancer detection using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, which contains both clinical/dermoscopic images and patient metadata. By combining visual and clinical data, the project explores how multimodal learning can improve early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.
